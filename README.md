Title : Real-Time Implementation of a Flexible,
Synchrophasor-based Wide-Area Damping Control
System

==============

The modern power grid is increasingly being used 
under operating conditions of increasing stress for which it was 
not designed, giving rise to grid stability issues. One of these 
stability issues is the phenomenon of low frequency, electro- 
mechanically induced, inter-area oscillations. Simulations have 
demonstrated the advantages of Wide Area Measurement Signals 
(WAMS)-based Power Oscillation Damping (POD) in achieving 
improved electromechanical mode damping compared to tradi- 
tional, local signal based, Power System Stabilizers (PSS). This 
work takes a Phasor-based oscillation damping algorithm and 
deploys it on a National Instruments real-time controller. The 
developed prototype is tested in a real-time Hardware-in-the-loop 
approach (RT-HIL) using OPAL-RT’s eMEGASIM real-time simulation platform and synchrophasor data from real PMU’s. It is     demonstrated to have applications independent of the controlled device. Challenges faced, the solutions implemented together with  the present prototype’s limitations are also discussed.
