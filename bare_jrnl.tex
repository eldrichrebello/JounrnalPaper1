% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
\usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex


\usepackage{epstopdf}


% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


\usepackage{mdwmath}
\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.


%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley and Jeff Goldberg.
% This package may be useful when used in conjunction with IEEEtran.cls'
% captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that submissions
% have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.3.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% For subfigure.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfigure\subfigure
% \renewcommand{\subfigure}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfigure[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat/subfig command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:

%The modern power grid is increasingly being used under operating conditions of increasing stress for which it was not designed, giving rise to grid stability issues. One of these stability issues is the phenomenon of low frequency, electro-mechanically induced, inter-area oscillations. Simulations have demonstrated the potential of Wide Area Measurement Signals (WAMS)-based Power Oscillation Damping (POD) in achieving improved electromechanical mode damping compared to traditional, local signal based, Power System Stabilizers (PSS). \iffalse Also, the adoption of synchrophasor measurement data from Phasor Measurement Units (PMU's) is rising annually.\fi This paper takes an established Phasor-based oscillation damping algorithm and combines it with modern PMU technology to implement a hardware prototype of a real-time oscillation damping control system using remote PMU signals sent over a communications network. The developed prototype is tested in real-time using a Hardware-in-the-loop approach in conjunction with the Klein-Rogers-Kundur two-area four-machine test system and is demonstrated to have applications independent of the controlled device.

%The developed hardware prototype has been tested using Real-Time hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) approach and the simulations are performed on Klien-Roger-Kundur two area four machine test system.

\section{Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{A}{lthough} the purpose of system interconnection was to increase stability, the present situation of the power system incorporates renewable energy sources and power trading corridors, both of which impact system stability. More modern solutions to the problems of inter-area and intra-area oscillations use Power System Stabilizers (PSS) \cite{WAPODNorway}. While a PSS provides excellent damping to intra-area modes with good local observability, its performance with inter-area modes may not be satisfactory \cite{localREMcomparison}. The limited observability in a local signal can be complimented by wide-area, synchrophasor data. 
%\subsection{Motivation}

\subsection{Literature Review}

\subsubsection*{Analytical Studies}

It has been shown in \cite{Yuwa} that wide-area signals are preferable to local signals, such as active power and frequency, \cite{localREMcomparison} for the purpose of damping inter-area oscillations. Studies such as \cite{Yuwa} have analysed damping performance when using signals such as voltage angle difference, which can easily be computed using data from multiple PMUs.

\subsubsection*{Field Tests}
Successful field trials of wide-area oscillation damping controllers are reported in \cite{WAPODNorway} and \cite{WAPODChina} indicating the potential that PMU-based wide area controllers have to offer. These results are not without certain limitations. In \cite{WAPODNorway} it is reported that the limited set of tests conducted with the Wide Area Power Oscillation Damper (WAPOD) are insufficient to compare the performance of a WAPOD to a local-measurement based controller.

\subsubsection*{Delay Studies} The damping performance of a controller that depends on TCP network-transmitted data for input is constrained by the network transport delay. Beyond a certain value of time delay, damping will cease to be effective. These effects are explored in more detail in \cite{CommDelay}.

\subsection{Paper Contributions}
The goal of this paper is to demonstrate both the potential and flexibility in oscillation damping controller design that is possible by using synchrophasors (IEEE C37.118). The Phasor Power Oscillation Damping (Phasor POD) algorithm originally developed by \"{A}ngquist and Gama\cite{PhasorPOD} is implemented and deployed on a National Instruments Compact Reconfigurable Input / Output (cRIO) real-time controller. A modified, \textsc{Simulink} model of the four-machine, two-area network developed by Klein-Rogers and Kundur \cite{KundurTwoArea} is executed in real-time on the eMEGASIM \cite{eMEGASIM} platform from OPAL-RT. \iffalse This allows interfacing an externally generated control signal with the simulated model in real-time.\fi A Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) test is set up to verify the performance of the hardware implementation of the Phasor POD algorithm. The flexibility of the developed controller is also demonstrated by extracting various data from the synchrophasor data-set and using each as a damping input to the controller. This paper also illustrates that the controller can have multiple applications by testing it with two different controllable devices; a generator automatic voltage regulator (AVR) system and a Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS)-device excitation system. A brief analysis of the performance of each synchrophasor input to the hardware POD is also presented.

%Problems exist with traditional damping controller design that is based around model linearisation and non-linear simulations \cite{WAPODChina}. This paper attempts to address these issues by adopting a phasor-based damping algorithm \cite{PhasorPOD} that is independent of the network configuration. The developed controller is designed with modularity and portability in mind and is demonstrated to be able to provide effective damping in multiple application scenarios. Although \cite{Yuwa} presents a scenario where the generator AVR\rq{s} error signal is modulated using PMU data, this work presents the first experimental validation of those results.

\subsection{Paper Organisation}

This paper is organised as follows. Section \ref{Background} presents a brief background of the work presented in this study while Section \ref{softhardware} presents the software and hardware used. Section \ref{SetupPreparation} covers the preparation of the \textsc{Simulink} models for real-time simulation and two real-time test cases, one with the WAPOD input fed to the excitation system of a Static VAR Compensator (SVC) and the other with the WAPOD modulating the input of a generator\rq{s} Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR). The results obtained from the two tests are presented and analysed in Section \ref{Results}. Section \ref{Challenges} examines some of the major challenges faced in the development, implementation and testing of this WAPOD controller. No experimental implementation is ever ready for the field and there is always room for improvement. This is outlined in Section \ref{Future} and finally conclusions are drawn in Section \ref{Conclusion}.

\section{Background}\label{Background}
As modern power systems grow in size, both in terms of power transfer capacity and geographic spread, they are increasingly being used for purposes that they were not designed for. Examples of these \textquoteleft new\textquoteright ~uses include conditions of increasing stress such as power trading between countries. These interconnections, which link synchronous generators, often separated by vast physical distances, create conditions where small disturbances can excite oscillations that may or may not settle. When the generators of one area oscillate at a low frequency (typically 0.2\textendash 2.5Hz) against the generators of another interconnected, but distinct area, \textquoteleft inter-area\textquoteright ~oscillations may be excited.
%Although the purpose of system interconnection was to increase stability, the present situation of the power system incorporates renewable energy sources and power trading corridors, both of which impact system stability. More modern solutions to the problems of inter area and intra oscillations use Power System Stabilizers (PSS) \cite{Dmello}. While a PSS provides excellent damping to intra area modes with good local observability, its performance with inter-area modes may not be satisfactory \cite{localREMcomparison}.\\

%\subsection{Previous Experiences}
\subsection{Controller Choice}  %one word missing between controller and choice. could be topology or design?
Traditional controllers for FACTS devices depend on accurate system models at a specific operating condition. Large systems often experience changes in their topology often and data about the present condition may not always be available. POD design is based on small signal and linear analysis techniques applied to power system models. These models are often difficult to derive accurately for large and inter-connected power systems \cite{WAMTCSC}. Linearised models are also only valid for small deviations from the linearisation point. One important reason for choosing the Phasor-POD algorithm for real-time implementation in this work was the fact that the algorithm uses few inputs and is independent of network configuration and topology. The only algorithm parameter that is network-dependent is the oscillation frequency and this is usually known from system studies or can be determined directly from synchrophasor measurements \cite{TaskForce}. Compared to conventional controllers designed using linearisation-based methods, the adoption of phasor-based controllers has not been high mainly due to the fact that such controllers tend to be highly non-linear and thus difficult to, both, model in simulation studies \cite{Chaudhuri} and implement in real-time applications \cite{WAPODNorway}.

Some of the problems that emerge from the model linearisation approach are addressed by phasor-based oscillation damping algorithms. The algorithm chosen for implementation here is the Phasor-POD algorithm, developed by \"{A}ngquist and Gama\cite{PhasorPOD}. The measured signal can be represented as a space-phasor \cite{Chaudhuri}: 

\begin{equation}
%\begin{multlined}
s(t)={s}_{avg}+\mathrm{Re}\left\{{\stackrel{\to }{s}}_{ph}\cdot {e}^{{jwt}}\right\}
%\mbox{where, } {\stackrel{\to }{s}}_{ph} \mbox{ is a complex phasor, rotating at the frequency }\\ \omega
%\end{multlined}
\end{equation}
%equation goes here!!

\noindent{where}, $\stackrel{\to }{s}_{ph}$ is a complex phasor, rotating at the frequency $\omega$ \cite{PhasorPOD}. This presents an average value and the associated oscillatory part, in a stationary reference frame. The oscillating part can then be used to generate a control signal for the FACTS (or other controllable device) using a control algorithm. This method is independent of the system state or configuration and is not computationally intensive. Controllers based on this approach may also incorporate error checking and phasor estimation algorithms. The real-time hardware implementation of the Phasor-POD algorithm was based on the \textsc{Simulink} implementation by Almas \& Vanfretti \cite{PhasorPODImplement} and its goal was to replicate the behaviour of the \textsc{Simulink} implementation as closely as possible. The algorithm accepts three inputs; the search frequency, $\omega_{cs1}$, the sampling time $T_{s}$, the phase correction $alpha$ in addition to a signal scaling factor. It takes advantage of the fact that the oscillation frequency for a given network configuration is usually known, which in this case is the 0.64Hz inter-area mode. Using this known frequency value, a  co-ordinate system, rotating at this known frequency, is set up where the oscillating component is continuously extracted as a phasor \cite{PhasorPOD}. The Phasor-POD algorithm essentially separates an input signal into an average valued and an oscillating component. The oscillating component, when suitably phase-shifted, can be used as a supplementary damping input to a generator's AVR or the excitation system of a FACTS device.

\section{Software Architecture and Hardware Configuration}\label{softhardware}

The Wide Area Power Oscillation Damper (WAPOD)\footnote{Historically, damping stabilizers have been termed WAPOD where the P represents a measurement of active power through the line. Active power here would be used as a controller input signal. Although this term is not accurate when other quantities are used as control inputs or feedback signals, the term is used here to maintain consistency with existing literature.} prototype developed here uses commercially available micro-controller hardware and is based entirely on PMU measurements received over a TCP/IP network. The Phasor-POD algorithm \cite{PhasorPOD} was implemented on a general purpose micro-controller and was executed in real-time. The inputs to the controller come from one or multiple PMU's, each monitoring data at different points in the power system. The power system model used in this paper is the two-area four-machine model, originally proposed by Klein, Rogers and Kundur \cite{KundurTwoArea}. To prove the real-world applicability of the developed controller, all tests are carried out in real-time, with conditions such as noise and network transport delay present.

\subsection{Hardware Configuration}
As illustrated in Figure \ref {Hardware_Outline}, all real-time simulations were performed on OPAL-RT's e\textsc{Megasim} \cite{eMEGASIM} real-time simulation platform. \textsc{Simulink} models are executed in real-time and are interfaced with externally generated signals in a HIL configuration. Current and voltage signals from different points (Buses 5 and 11 in Figure \ref{NetworkOutline}) on the simulated network are extracted, amplified and then supplied as the input to two PMUs. Two cRIO-9076 \cite{cRIO9081} devices are used as PMUs. Each is equipped with three-phase analogue voltage and current input modules. The PMUs report data every 20 ms. The synchrophasor data stream (C37.118) generated by these PMUs is streamed over a TCP/IP network to a Phasor Data Concentrator (PDC) which produces a time-aligned output stream. This stream is then accessed, via a TCP/IP network, on a PC running LabVIEW. Data is extracted and sent to the FPGA running the Phasor-POD algorithm. The FPGA on the cRIO-9081 \cite{cRIO9081} generates a damping signal which is then wired to the real-time simulator for use in the \textsc{Simulink} model.

\begin{figure}[!h]

\caption{Harware Outline showing complete data path}
\label{Hardware_Outline}
\end{figure}

Vanfretti et. al. describe the details of the equipment used here in \cite{PhasorPODImplement}. It is important to note that the data flow in Figure~\ref{Hardware_Outline} involves both D/A and A/D conversions. Also, since no synchronisation is used for these conversions, it is important that the sample rates or loop rates of each section be integer multiples of each other. This will prevent data value errors. The issue of different loop rates is discussed in Section \ref{looprate}.

%An image of the physical setup is included for clarity in Appendix \ref{SetupImage}. 

\subsection{Software Architecture}
%The two-area four-machine model used here is available in \textsc{Simulink}'s SimPowerSystems. The \textsc{Simulink} implementation of the Phasor-POD algorithm was developed by Almas and Vanfretti \cite{PhasorPODImplement}. \\

As shown in Figure \ref{RTArchitecture}, LabVIEW's Real Time and Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) modules were used to write the code for the respective sections of the cRIO. Also,  since no synchrophasor data-extraction software was available that could run independently on the RT controller, the process of extracting raw measurement data from the synchrophasor data stream was performed on a desktop computer. The software used for this was Statnett\rq{s} Synchrophasor Software Development Kit ($S^{3}$DK) \cite{SDK} which runs on a workstation computer, extracts data from the PMU stream and sends this extracted data to a LabVIEW program running on the same computer \cite{SDK}. Using the $S^{3}$DK a LabVIEW application was implemented to select the PMU\rq{s} from which the data was to be utilized. Once available in LabVIEW, this data was then sent to the RT controller using LabVIEW\rq{s} Shared Variables \cite{LabViewManuals} over a TCP network.

\subsection{Real-Time Implementation of Phasor-POD Algorithm}

%\begin{figure}[!th]
%\centering
%\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{FPGA_Block_Diagram.png} 
%\caption{Software Architecture of RT Controller}
%\label{RTSoftware}
%\end{figure}

The hardware implementation of the POD was based on the Compact Reconfigurable Input / Output (cRIO) 9081 \cite{cRIO9081} from National Instruments. This controller is equipped with an on-board FPGA (maximum clock speed of 80Mhz\footnote{\url{http://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/data_sheets/ds162.pdf}}) in addition to an independent real-time controller (1.06GHz Intel Celeron U3405). 
%update figure to show that Local control function was NOT implemented. Future work!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

\includegraphics[width=5in]{Final_RT_Arch.png} 
\caption{Three-layer Software and Hardware Architecture of the WAPOD Controller. Loop rates are indicated in red.} %showing future expandability with Local control function
\label{RTArchitecture}
\end{figure*}

A three-layer, modular code architecture, following guidelines from the manufacturer \cite{LabviewTemplate}, was selected for implementation. An outline of the architecture is shown in Figure \ref{RTArchitecture} and each of the three layers are briefly described below (Corresponding to the numbers in Figure \ref{RTArchitecture}). 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Remote Interface: Runs on a standard, workstation computer. Used to update algorithm parameters and monitor data \& performance. Receives the synchrophasor data stream and extracts measured value data. This  layer is non deterministic in time.

\item Real Time (RT) Software : Manages network communication to the remote terminal and also generates performance monitoring data. The remote interface interacts with this layer over the communication network.

\item Core FPGA Software : Interacts with hardware terminals for I/O and runs the Phasor-POD algorithm. Input data comes through the RT interface running on the cRIO.

\end{enumerate}

The Phasor-POD algorithm could be implemented on either the real-time section of the cRIO or the FPGA but was implemented on the FPGA. This decision was made keeping in mind the computational resources and response speed needed to match the step size of the real-time simulator. The complexity of the code meant that the cRIO\rq{s} real-time controller would not be able to complete an iteration of the algorithm in the required 50$\mu$s response time. The real-time section of the cRIO handles network communication. Its primary purpose is to receive measurement data that the workstation computer extracts and to stream this data to the Phasor-POD algorithm running on the FPGA. The real-time controller also handles commands coming from the user interface running on the workstation computer.  It also monitors the output of the FPGA, sends data to the user interface for monitoring, periodically logs input and output data and handles error conditions.\\

The remote interface runs in LabVIEW on a conventional computer. The Phasor-POD algorithm can be controlled and monitored from this interface. Since the operating system here is not real-time but is multi-tasking, the execution speed depends on the processor load and is not deterministic. Statnett's $S^{3}DK$ was used to unwrap the PMU streams coming from the PDC and extract phasor measurements \cite{SDK}. This allowed for data to be extracted and used directly in the LabVIEW environment. Since the PMU reporting rate was 50 messages a second, new data was available every 20ms. The loop rate used by the $S^{3}DK$ was hence 20ms. The selection of an input signal for the controller and any signal processing required are performed here. For example, if active power is to be used as a POD input, voltage and current values must be multiplied to obtain the active power. If the voltage angle difference is to be used as an input, the required calculations are performed in this LabVIEW Virtual Instrument (VI\footnote{A LabVIEW program. See \url{http://www.ni.com/white-paper/7001/en/}}).

\section{Experimental Setup Preparation}\label{SetupPreparation}

The nature of the Phasor-POD algorithm is generic enough to allow it to be used as a modulating input to a variety of controlled devices. Two examples are illustrated in this work, one, as a damping controller modulating a generator\rq{s} AVR and the other as a modulating input to the excitation system of a FACTS device (here, an SVC\footnote{Static VAR Compensator}). Figure \ref{NetworkOutline} illustrates both these uses along with the two-area network outline. Note that both possibilities are not implemented simultaneously.

\caption{Damping performance of the base case PSS only at Machine M1}
\label{PSS_Degrade}
\end{figure}

%The two-area network \cite{KundurTwoArea} is known to be unstable without external damping control. 
The original Klein-Rogers-Kundur model in \cite{KundurTwoArea} was modified for the studies in this paper. In order to assess the performance of the WAPOD, the base case employs a damping control system (PSS) only at Machine M1 in Area-1 (see~Figure~\ref{NetworkOutline}). All other machines do not have a PSS installed. This configuration was  verified to be able to both achieve stability and to be able to restore the system to stability after the application (and subsequent clearing) of an 8 cycle, three-phase to ground fault at bus 8 in Figure \ref{NetworkOutline}. To demonstrate a potential application scenario for the developed POD prototype, the performance of the PSS was set up so that it is able to provide damping but with a long response and settling time (Figure \ref{PSS_Degrade}). This figure shows the system response to a 200 ms., 5\% perturbation in the voltage reference of machine M1. Note that under the action of the sole PSS at machine M1, the inter-area mode is damped and the system is restored to stability. This mimics a real-world situation where an already installed PSS whose performance has degraded over time due to changing network conditions or poor tuning. The next section illustrates that the addition of the WAPOD as an additional damping control aids damping performance when the conventional PSS cannot be recalibrated immediately.

\label{NetworkOutline}
\end{figure*}

%The \textsc{Simulink} model used here implements damping control using a supplementary signal generated from a PSS and applied to the excitation system of each of the machines to achieve steady-state stability and also to damp out the inter-area mode.

%The difference between the rotational inertias of two of the machines, in an otherwise symmetric network gives rise to the 0.64Hz inter-area mode. 

%Details of the two-area model parameters are listed in Appendix \ref{LiiteC}.\\


\subsection{Two-Area Model Preparation - FACTS Device}

The second application in Figure \ref{NetworkOutline} is to use the WAPOD output as a modulating input to an SVC's excitation system. The two-area model was prepared for simulation in the same way as in the previous case except that a PSS was included at all four machines. The SVC model implemented was an average-value model (Figure \ref{SVC_Model}), identical to that used in \cite{PhasorPODImplement}. The SVC was connected at the mid-point of the two area network (Bus 8 in Figure \ref{NetworkOutline}). As shown by Chow \& Larsen in \cite{sVARdamp}, this is the point where voltage swings will be the greatest and also where the SVC can be most effective at damping power swings. Two parallel and identical implementations of the Phasor-POD algorithm were used, one implemented in SIMULINK and the other on the cRIO. Either could be switched in at a given time. It is important to note here that when the hardware-POD was switched in, the PSS's at each of the four machines were disconnected, leaving the SVC as the sole control and damping device in the network. The ability of the SVC to keep the network stable and also to restore it to stability was verified with off-line simulations using the Phasor-POD implemented in \textsc{Simulink}. In addition, the performance of the PSS's were not modified as the Phasor-POD algorithm would not be running in parallel with them.

%\end{figure}
\vspace{-0.7em}
\subsection{Real-Time Simulation}
The modified network in each case was grouped into sub-systems and prepared for simulation using RT-LAB \cite{eMEGASIM}. The simulation time step chosen was 50$\mu$s. The outputs and inputs of the real-time simulator were updated every 50$\mu$s. Current and voltage measurements were taken from the points marked in Figure \ref{NetworkOutline} and were extracted from the analogue outputs of the real-time simulator. The damping signal \emph{dVpod} in Figure~\ref{NetworkOutline} was generated at two points; one in the real-time simulation itself using a \textsc{Simulink} implementation of the Phasor POD algorithm and one externally on the cRIO. Both signals were generated simultaneously and either one could be switched in for use in the simulation.

\section{Testing \& Results}\label{Results}
The POD algorithm implemented in \textsc{Simulink} uses the locally available active power measurements as input. In the case of the Generator PSS, this is the active power measured at the terminals of the generator. In the case of the SVC, the active power at the mid-point of the interconnecting line (also the point of connection of the SVC) is used as an input. The WAPOD hardware prototype was able to use the same signal as an input in each case but can also exploit other data contained in the synchrophasor data stream. Testing the operation of the hardware prototype involved using the HIL setup outlined in Figure~\ref{Hardware_Outline} and verifying whether steady state stability could be maintained in the simulated two-area network. Once this was demonstrated, the inter-area mode was excited by perturbing the voltage reference $V_{ref}$ of Machine M1. The oscillations caused by this disturbance would then be damped out by the PSS in tandem with the Phasor POD algorithm. Testing was carried out in several phases, one with the \textsc{Simulink} POD connected and the other with the cRIO-based WAPOD connected to the real-time simulation. In the latter case, three different damping inputs were tested: active power, positive sequence current magnitude and the voltage angle difference between buses 5 and 11 in Figure \ref{NetworkOutline}.
\vspace{-0.7em}
\subsection{SVC Excitation Supplementary Input}
Figure \ref{SVC_Plots} illustrates the response of the hardware controller to a small disturbance at machine M1. This disturbance is a 5\% change for 200 ms. in the reference voltage of the AVR. This is sufficient to excite the inter-area mode. The best damping performance is achieved using voltage angle difference as a damping input to the Phasor-POD algorithm. This supports the theoretical results predicted by Chompoobutrgool and Vanfretti in \cite{Yuwa}. Response parameters such as settling times and overshoot were calculated based on the response in Figure \ref{SVC_Plots} and are presented in Table \ref{SVCResponseTable}. The response of the simulated POD (in \textsc{Simulink}) was used as a baseline to calculate the overshoot. The settling time is calculated as the time required for the response of the controller (in volts) to be constrained to +/- 1V.
%A frequency analysis of each of these responses shows that the dominant mode in each response is the 0.64Hz inter-area mode.\\
\begin{table}[!ht]
\caption{Response Parameters : SVC Excitation Supplementary Input}\label{SVCResponseTable}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline \textbf{Input Parameter} & \textbf{Percentage Overshoot} & \textbf{Settling Time (s)} \\

%This is evident in Figure \ref{FourierAngle}, which presents the magnitude spectrum of the controller response with voltage angle as input.

All data presented in Figure \ref{SVC_Plots} was captured in the real-time simulator. Data was also recorded at other points such as at the PDC but these have a lower resolution and are thus not presented here. As further proof of the results presented in this work, the output of the hardware controller is captured directly using an oscilloscope (Figure \ref{ScopeCapture}).

\subsection{Generator Excitation Supplementary Input}

The controller response to a small disturbance when operating in tandem with a degraded PSS is shown in Figure~\ref{Generator_Plots}. It is evident that the combination of the WAPOD and the PSS is significantly better than the PSS alone in every case. It can also be noted that the response of the damping signal is significantly different from that in Figure~\ref{SVC_Plots}, where the dominant 0.64Hz mode is clearly visible. Also evident from Figure~\ref{Generator_Plots} is the fact that the damping performance of the WAPOD changes significantly as its input is changed. Using the voltage angle difference as input provides the best performance. The performance with the simulated POD algorithm is not shown in Figure~\ref{Generator_Plots} for clarity. The performance of the WAPOD with the voltage angle difference input is very close to the performance of the simulated POD algorithm that uses local active power as input. This performance is achieved despite the presence of a stochastic time delay and noise in the input measurements of the WAPOD. As in the case with the SVC, the theoretical results in \cite{Yuwa} agree with the experimental results presented here.

\section{Challenges}\label{Challenges}

\subsection{Time Delays}

The Phasor POD algorithm implemented in \textsc{Simulink} has close to zero time delay between the power system changing and the controller responding. The same algorithm, when run on the cRIO, receives data with a stochastic delay. It is evident from Figure~\ref{Hardware_Outline} that several sources of stochastic time delay exist. Sections such as the analogue amplifiers, the FPGA (50$\mu$s) and the real-time section of the cRIO all represent fixed, non-zero time delays. Elements such as the D/A and A/D conversion in the real-time simulator also add a deterministic time delay. However, elements in the data path such as TCP/IP network communication and the PC used to extract raw measurement data from the PDC synchrophasor stream all represent variable delays. The total delay allows for a network disturbance to grow slightly before the cRIO starts responding. It also has the effect of changing the phase compensation required in the Phasor-POD algorithm. Observe that the phase compensation needed can be changed from the remote interface, depending on the measured delay. The experimentally measured end-to-end delay over the complete data path in Figure \ref{Hardware_Outline} averaged 283.1 ms. This was calculated by logging data in the real-time simulator and measuring the delay between the power system response and the controller response. Data for this is presented in Table \ref{DelayData}. Presently, the phase compensation required is determined iteratively however, this can be automated using time-stamped data together with an adaptive controller.

\subsection{Analogue Limits and Noise}
The original POD algorithm~\cite{PhasorPOD} was developed and simulated in an ideal, noise-free environment with zero delay. More importantly, no limits are imposed on the magnitude of either the controller's inputs or outputs in a simulation. In contrast, a hardware-based implementation using analogue signals is constrained by the analogue signal limits (see Figure \ref{ScalingProblem}). Consider the analogue outputs of OPAL-RT's eMEGASIM simulator which are rated for $\pm16V$ or $\pm10mA$  \cite{eMEGASIM}.

%\item \textbf{Analogue Inputs} : Number: 128 (+/-100V and +/-10mA)
%\end{itemize}
These are low level outputs and can be directly connected to the low-voltage level PMU inputs. However, the standard input modules of typical PMU's are rated for 0-300V and a 0-16V analogue signal will not use a significant portion of this range. Additionally, a signal of such a small magnitude will be contaminated by noise and will consequently have a poor Signal to Noise ratio. A similar argument can be made for the current outputs. The solution involved amplifying the analogue signals from the real-time simulator to levels that used more of the dynamic change of the PMU input modules. This simultaneously improves both accuracy and the signal-to-noise ratio.

The output of the simulated POD can vary over several orders of magnitude, ranging from $10^{5}$ at times of peak damping to as small as $10^{-3}$ once the oscillation magnitude  becomes small. It is difficult to accurately recreate analogue signals with such vast dynamic ranges. The voltage output module used here had a 24-bit resolution and was limited to $\pm 10V$ in magnitude. Any values generated by the POD algorithm that were greater in magnitude that 10V would cause output saturation. All these issues meant that signal magnitudes had to be amplified in certain cases to use the full measurement ranges or had to be limited in other cases, so as to capture variations without saturation.

\subsection{Loop Rates and FPGA Resources}\label{looprate}
The most significant challenge in the real-time implementation of the Phasor-POD algorithm was the fact that different sections of the hardware control loop run at different loop rates or step sizes (see Figure \ref{RTArchitecture}). Added to this was the fact that the real-time simulator generated data every 50 $\mu$s (and thus expected data from the HIL set-up at the same rate) while the rest of the HIL set-up did not support such a high data rate. The PMUs used supported a maximum reporting rate of 50 samples/second. Table~\ref{ex:LoopRates} lists the different components of the HIL set-up together with their respective loop rates.
\begin{table}[!ht]
\caption{Comparison of Loop Rates of Different Components}\label{ex:LoopRates}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline \textbf{Element} & \textbf{Loop Rate} & \textbf{Mode} \\
\hline OPAL-RT Simulator & 50$\mu$s & Real Time \\ 
\hline PMU (cRIO) & 20msec & Real Time \\ 
\hline Workstation Computer& 20msec & Not Real Time \\ 
\hline PDC & 20msec & Not Real-Time \\ %check data here
\hline POD - RT Section & 20msec & Real Time \\ 
\hline POD - FPGA & 50$\mu$s & Real Time \\ 
\hline 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table} 

50 $\mu$s. was chosen for the FPGA loop rate in order to match the loop rate of the real-time simulator. This was to ensure that data was always available at the analogue input of the simulator and no erroneous data points were read. The 50 $\mu$s. loop rate of the FPGA meant that new data was expected every 50 $\mu$s., corresponding to a 20000 samples per second PMU sampling rate. The fastest execution speed of the real-time section of the cRIO was 1ms, significantly slower than the FPGA\rq{s} speed. New synchrophasor data was available from the PMUs only every 20 ms. One solution to this problem was to up-sample the synchrophasor data, interpolate between consecutive data points and then stream this data to the Phasor-POD algorithm on the FPGA. The major problem with this method was that the up-sampling process on the RT controller is computationally intensive and would not run at the required 20 ms. loop rate. An alternative solution was a sample and hold algorithm implemented on the FPGA. As data was extracted every 20 ms., the RT controller would receive this data and send it to the FPGA. This value would then be held constant till the next data point arrived. This was implemented and found to work satisfactorily. %The difference between the Phasor-POD algorithm running the \textsc{Simulink} simulation and that on the cRIO was the data rates of their respective input data. The simulated POD received new data every 50 $\mu$s. while the cRIO-based POD received data every 20 ms.

\subsection{FPGA Numeric Data Formats and Accuracy}

While the FPGA is a fast, deterministic and reliable computational device, it brings with it some limitations. Most of these arise from the fact that an FPGA has no operating system and all circuit logic is directly implemented in hardware. All computations are performed at the bit level, limiting the amount and complexity of computations that can be performed. Functions such as division or multiplication consume significant space on the FPGA\cite{LabViewManuals}. The FPGA on the cRIO9081 implements a unique numeric representation called Fixed Point\cite{LabViewManuals}. Here, the number of bits assigned to represent the integer and fractional part of a number is fixed before code execution\cite{LabViewManuals}. This representation is similar to binary in the sense that increasing and decreasing powers of 2 are used to represent the integer and fractional parts of a number, respectively.

Floating point calculations, although possible, consume significant space on the FPGA and are typically slower than corresponding fixed-point calculations\cite{LabViewManuals}. Trigonometric functions such as a sine or cosine can be implemented using specifically designed code that takes several clock cycles to execute. A trade-off has to be made between code execution speed and accuracy. The Phasor POD algorithm implemented in this work uses floating point calculations, multiplication, division operations and  trigonometric operations.

Due to the FPGA design, not all these calculations can be performed in the same data format. The FPGA-specific data format, the Fixed Point representation, is used to optimise complex computations such as those required in trigonometric functions. The drawback of this representation is that a trade-off must be made between the accuracy achieved and the range of values that can be represented. Keeping in mind the fact that the input values to the POD algorithm are not necessarily limited in magnitude, the POD algorithm is implemented using Floating-point numbers. Certain functions used in the algorithm, such as trigonometric functions, use FPGA-optimised code and require input and output in the fixed-point representation. Conversion between these two formats (Fixed and Floating point) sometimes results in errors. The floating-point format includes a representation for calculations that result in infinite or complex values, called \texttt{NaN} (Not a Number)\cite{LabViewManuals}. This representation is not available in the fixed-point format and conversion results in errors.
%The most common result is that a conversion from a floating-point NaN results in a fixed-point number where all the bits are \texttt{1}. This produces a finite number and is incorrect. 

%A significant problem here was the fact that the synchrophasor data-extraction software running the on the workstation computer was not running in real-time. This, together with the TCP/IP sections, introduced stochastic delay in the control loop. 
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Further Work}\label{Future}

The WAPOD prototype as developed in this work together with the experimental tests give strong evidence of the possibilities and benefits of using wide area synchrophasor data for damping control, as theorised in \cite{Yuwa}. The prototype here is, however, dependent on manual input for signal selection and algorithm parameter values. These two processes can be automated by having the WAPOD itself monitor the various input signals and intelligently select the one having the highest observability of a particular mode \cite{Yuwa}. The algorithm parameters, including the required phase compensation due to a stochastically varying delay, can also be determined adaptively on the WAPOD itself. On the same lines, this can further be extended to include selection among several measurement locations on the network. The fact that a stochastic time delay is introduced by unwrapping the synchrophasor data stream on a desktop computer can be addressed by performing this function on the WAPOD controller (here, the cRIO) itself thus making the whole control loop more deterministic. The HIL system at present includes several sources of stochastic delay besides the delay caused by TCP communication. The HIL set-up can also be expanded to use actual generator excitation control hardware such as ABB's ECS system.

\section{Conclusion}\label{Conclusion}
This work has provided experimental proof of the feasibility and benefits of using wide-area power system measurements as an input to an oscillation damping controller. The generic nature of the developed controller was demonstrated by using an identical implementation with mere changes in parameters to suit the controlled device's input requirements and capabilities. The hardware prototype developed on the NI cRIO was tested in a real-time HIL setup and was demonstrated to work satisfactorily. The performance of the WAPOD can be improved by exploiting the full range of data available in a synchrophasor data stream. The flexibility of synchrophasor data was demonstrated and the wide range of inputs possible from this were also tested. The results from this work serve as experimental proof-of-concept to the theory presented in \cite{Yuwa} and pave the way for the development of other PMU-based real-time control systems.

%\section{Modifications Made to PSS Model}
%
%The default simulation model supplied with the \texttt{power\_PSS} example in \textsc{Matlab} has three types of PSS models \cite{MATLABexample} : an MB-PSS, a $\Delta\omega $-PSS and a $\Delta P_{a}$ PSS. The comparison of the three as presented in \cite{MATLABexample} concludes that the performance of the MB-PSS is the best. This model is thus, not used when modulating the PSS output with the Phasor-POD algorithm. Instead, the $\delta P_{a}$ PSS is used. The PSS model here is the generic PSS model available with SimPowerSystems \cite{PSSDocumentation}.\\
%
%The input to the $\Delta\omega $-PSS is the rotor speed deviation $\Delta\omega $. For an accurate comparison, this was changed to the measured active power measured at the generator terminals, $P_{a}$. The lead-lag block parameters were also changed from $\frac{1 + 50x10^{-3}s}{1 + 1s}$ to $\frac{1 + 50x10^{-3}s}{1 + 6s}$. Parameters here were determined iteratively. The change to the lead-lag block produces the effect in Figure \ref{PSS_Degrade} where the PSS is still able to restore the system to stability but takes almost a minute to damp out the oscillations versus approximately three seconds in the ideal case.\\

\section{SmarTS Lab Outline}

%The SmarTS Lab at KTH was set up with the aim of developing wide area monitoring, protection and control (WAMPAC) schemes for the power grid. Much of the infrastructure and activities involve PMU data and the associated communication and computer systems  \cite{SmarTSLab}. The lab is equipped with facilities for real-time (RT) simulations and also RT Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) tests. A reduced schematic is shown in Figure \ref{fig:SmarTSlabOutline}

%The core of the setup is the eMEGASIM Real-time simulator from OPAL RT ~\cite{eMEGASIM}. Two \textquoteleft targets' are available,  each running a 12-core 3.3Ghz Intel i7 processor \cite{SmarTSLab}. This allows the running of models created in \textsc{Matlab}/Simulink in real-time. These simulations can interact with external devices through the simulator's low-power analogue outputs and inputs or with data streamed over TCP/IP, UDP etc \cite{SmarTSLab}. In this thesis, the power system under test is simulated on this platform.\\

%The analogue outputs and their ratings are listed below:\label{OPALlimits}
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item \textbf{Analogue Outputs} : 32 (+/-16V and +/-10mA)
%\item \textbf{Analogue Inputs} : 128 (+/-100V and +/-10mA)
%\end{itemize}

The full listing of the SmarTS Lab, the simulator's capabilities and its interfaces is covered in \cite{PhasorPODImplement} and \cite{SmarTSLab}. The reader is referred to these sources for a better understanding of the hardware described here.
%The WAMPAC platform includes a Phasor Data Concentrator (PDC) and its associated software from Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories (SEL). Other devices are interfaced with the PDC such as protection relays with embedded PMU functionality, line differential protection relays (ABB), Compact RIO micro-controllers (National Instruments) and analogue signal amplifiers (Megger)\cite{SmarTSLab}. The hardware list here is incomplete and other devices are also used such as a GPS receiver, a relay current and voltage injection kit etc.
